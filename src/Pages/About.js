        In 2003, Guru & Jana planted the seed for a visionary aspiration. From that small beginning, we carefully nurtured and nourished our shared vision, watching it germinate into a diverse group of like-minded individuals forming the roots of a solid foundation.

        <p className='mx-auto leading-relaxed my-6 text-base mb-4'>
        Our journey took a significant leap in 2010 when we embarked on a mission to be among the Top 20 Chartered Accountancy firms in India by 2020 - we called it Vision 202020. As we glance the past decade, we cherish the journey with pride. However, our 600+ team is not resting on our laurels; we are continually striving for more, setting new targets, and aspiring to reach greater heights with unique visions.

        <p className='mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'> 
        Our actions, attitudes, and values have helped us branch out and diversify into authoring 3 books, of which one is a national best seller, starting each day with a shared anthem, educating 250+ children, and working towards uplifting the social sector. We are committed to making a difference, both in our industry and in society, and we invite you to join us on this journey of growth and impact.
